## TakeoutFM

We are indie developers that build the free (as in freedom)
software behind [Takeout](https://takeoutfm.com/takeout.html). We use open
source cross-platform technology like [Go](https://go.dev/), [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) 
and [Dart](https://dart.dev/) to support as many platforms as possible.

Source code is available here on Github. See below for pre-compiled releases.
